# Swept Away

## Description

A [Processing](https://processing.org/) game that gives the player control of a wrecking ball. The goal is to hit--or sweep--the target ball at the bottom of the screen. The wrecking ball acts as a pendulum, and clicking in the window allows the player to extend the arm of the pendulum. Letting go of the mouse will retract the arm back to its normal length.
